# To-Do List

## Metadata
- Fetching and embedding richer metadata (e.g., track title, artist, album) from the AcoustID database or other music metadata services.
- Adding support for other relevant music metadata services or databases.

## Dependencies
- Investigating and potentially integrating a WebAssembly (WASM) or pure JavaScript version of `fpcalc` to reduce reliance on external binary dependencies and simplify user setup.

## Features
- Implementing more advanced batch processing options or developing a library mode for programmatic use.
