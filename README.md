# amusic

`amusic` is a command-line music utility for the care and feeding of local music
libraries.

Initially inspired by `rsgain` (especially its `easy` mode), its early evolution
is focused on augmenting its capabilities with generating and embedding AcoustID
fingerprints.

## Features

- **ReplayGain generation** â€” Calculates and embeds ReplayGain metadata. This
  helps audio players avoid the common problem of having to manually adjust
  volume levels between tracks when playing audio from albums that have been
  mastered at different loudness levels.
- **AcoustID Fingerprint Generation** â€” Calculates and embeds an AcoustID
  fingerprint (`ACOUSTID_FINGERPRINT` tag). This uniquely identifies an audio
  file (typically a music track), which will later help associate the audio file
  with metadata including Title, Artist, Album, and lots more.
- **High-quality AAC encoding** â€” On macOS, `amusic` can encode lossless audio
  (FLAC, WAV, ALAC) to audibly-transparent `.m4a` files using Apple's Core Audio
  framework.
- **Intelligent Folder Processing** â€” Automatically treats folders as albums by
  default, with support for processing entire music libraries organized by
  artist/album hierarchy.
- **Parallel Processing** â€” Uses worker pools to process multiple tracks
  concurrently for improved performance.
- **Unified Processing** â€” Process tracks once with multiple operations
  (encoding, ReplayGain, AcoustID) in a single pass.
- **Force Overwrite** â€” Optionally, users can force AcoustID fingerprints to be
  re-calculated and overwritten even for files that already have them using the
  `--force` flag.
- **Quiet Mode** â€” Use the `-q`/`--quiet` flag to suppress detail displayed
  during processing. Errors and the final summary report are still displayed.
- **Summary Report** â€” After all files are processed, a summary is shown
  detailing the number of files successfully processed, skipped, or failed.

### To Do

- ðŸš§ **Apple SoundCheck generation** â€” Calculates and embeds Apple SoundCheck
  metadata, which is Apple's equivalent of ReplayGain.

### AcoustID Processing Details

The script queries the AcoustID web service using the generated fingerprint and
an AcoustID API key. You can provide your API key via the `--api-key <key>`
option or by setting the `ACOUSTID_API_KEY` environment variable:

```bash
# Set your key in the environment (once per session)
export ACOUSTID_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Then run without repeating the flag:
amusic <file1> [file2 ...]
```

Alternatively, you can pass the key directly:

```bash
amusic --api-key $ACOUSTID_API_KEY <file1> [file2 ...]
```

It retrieves and embeds the `ACOUSTID_ID` (the UUID from the AcoustID database);
it does NOT fetch or embed other metadata (like track title, artist, album), but
this may be supported in a future release.

## Dependencies

`amusic` requires only Deno to run. All audio metadata operations are handled by
the built-in taglib-wasm library, and the required external tools are included
as vendor binaries:

- **Deno**: The runtime for the script. Installation instructions can be found
  at [https://deno.land/](https://deno.land/).
- **taglib-wasm**: Universal audio metadata library (included as npm
  dependency). Handles all tag reading/writing operations for MP3, M4A/MP4,
  FLAC, OGG, WAV, and more.
- **fpcalc**: Used for generating AcoustID fingerprints. Native binaries are
  included in the `vendor` directory for all supported platforms.
- **rsgain**: Used for ReplayGain analysis and metadata tagging. Native binaries
  are included in the `vendor` directory for all supported platforms.

No external tools need to be installed - everything is self-contained within the
project.

## Installation

### Option 1: Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

Once the Homebrew tap is set up, you can install amusic with:

```bash
brew tap CharlesWiltgen/tap
brew install amusic
```

To update to the latest version:

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade amusic
```

### Option 2: Download Pre-built Binary

Download the latest release for your platform from the
[Releases](https://github.com/CharlesWiltgen/amusic/releases) page. Pre-built
binaries are available for:

- macOS (Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3 and Intel)
- Linux (x86_64)
- Windows (x86_64)

Extract the archive and optionally move the binary to a location in your PATH.

### Option 3: Build from Source

1. Ensure Deno is installed.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CharlesWiltgen/amusic.git
   cd amusic
   ```
3. (Optional) Build a standalone executable (includes the platform-specific
   vendor binaries):

   ```bash
   deno task build
   ```

> **Note (macOS)**\
> The build task will automatically remove any quarantine attributes and perform
> an ad-hoc code signing of the generated `dist/amusic` binary so that the
> embedded vendor tools (`fpcalc`/`rsgain`) can be executed without encountering
> "No such file or directory (os error 2)".

## Usage

> **Note:** If you've built a standalone executable using `deno task build`, you
> can run it directly from `dist/amusic`:

```bash
./dist/amusic [options] <file1> [file2 ...]
```

To use `amusic`, navigate to the directory containing `amusic.ts` and run the
script using `deno run`. Provide the paths to the audio files you want to
process as arguments.

**Syntax:**

```bash
deno run --allow-read --allow-run --allow-write --allow-env --allow-net amusic.ts [options] <file1> [file2 ...]
```

- `--allow-read`: Required to read audio files.
- `--allow-run`: Required to execute vendor binaries (`fpcalc` and `rsgain`).
- `--allow-write`: Required to write updated audio files with new tags.
- `--allow-env`: Required to read environment variables like `ACOUSTID_API_KEY`.
- `--allow-net`: Required for AcoustID API lookups (optional, only needed when
  using API key).
- `<file1> [file2 ...]`: One or more paths to audio files to be processed.

**Options:**

- `-f, --force`: Force recalculation and saving of the AcoustID fingerprint even
  if existing AcoustID tags are found in the file. Without this flag, files with
  existing tags will be skipped.
- `-q, --quiet`: Suppress informational output during processing. Error messages
  and the final summary report will still be displayed.
- `--show-tags`: Display existing `ACOUSTID_ID` and `ACOUSTID_FINGERPRINT` tags
  for the specified files and then exit. This option does not modify files or
  perform any online lookups.
- `--dry-run`: Simulate the entire tagging process, including fingerprint
  generation and AcoustID API lookups (if an `--api-key` is provided), but do
  not make any actual changes to the audio files. This is useful for testing or
  previewing what actions would be performed. A notice will be shown in the
  summary report if a dry run was performed.

After processing all files, a summary report is displayed, showing the number of
files successfully processed, skipped, and failed.

## Commands

### Default Command: AcoustID Processing

Process files to generate and embed AcoustID fingerprints:

```bash
amusic [options] <files...>
```

### Easy Mode: Process Music Library

Process a music library organized by album folders. Calculates ReplayGain for
each album and AcoustID for each track:

```bash
amusic easy <library> [options]
```

### Process Command: Unified Processing

Process audio files with multiple operations in a single pass. By default,
folders are treated as albums:

```bash
amusic process [options] <paths...>
```

Options:

- `--encode`: Encode files to M4A/AAC format
- `--replay-gain`: Calculate and apply ReplayGain metadata
- `--acoust-id`: Generate and embed AcoustID fingerprints
- `--singles <patterns...>`: Folder patterns to treat as singles instead of
  albums
- `-o, --output-dir <dir>`: Output directory for encoded files
- `--force-lossy-transcodes`: Allow encoding from lossy formats (not
  recommended)

### Encode Command: High-Quality AAC Encoding

Encode lossless audio files to M4A/AAC format (macOS only):

```bash
amusic encode [options] <files...>
```

Options:

- `-o, --output-dir <dir>`: Output directory for encoded files
- `--flatten-output`: Put all output files in a single directory
- `--force-lossy-transcodes`: Allow encoding from lossy formats (MP3, OGG)

## Folder Processing Behavior

By default, `amusic` intelligently processes folders:

- **Leaf folders** (containing audio files but no subfolders) are treated as
  **albums**
- **Parent folders** (containing subfolders) have each subfolder processed as
  potential albums
- **Singles override**: Use `--singles` patterns to treat specific folders as
  collections of individual tracks

This makes it easy to process entire music libraries organized by artist/album
hierarchy.

## Examples

1. **Generate and add fingerprint to an audio file:**

   ```bash
   amusic "./path/to/your/music file.mp3"
   ```

2. **Process an album folder:** Calculate and embed ReplayGain metadata and
   generate AcoustID fingerprints for all tracks in a single folder:

   ```bash
   amusic process --replay-gain --acoust-id "/path/to/album_folder"
   ```

3. **Process multiple artists with some singles folders:**

   ```bash
   amusic process --encode --replay-gain --acoust-id \
     --singles "Singles" --singles "Compilations" \
     "/Music/Prince" "/Music/Madonna" "/Music/Singles"
   ```

4. **Encode a library to a new location preserving structure:**

   ```bash
   amusic encode -o "/path/to/output" "/path/to/lossless/library"
   ```

5. **Easy Mode: Process entire music library:**

   ```bash
   amusic easy /path/to/music/library --api-key $ACOUSTID_API_KEY
   ```

6. **Process with unified command for maximum efficiency:**

   ```bash
   # Process everything in one pass: encode to M4A, calculate ReplayGain, and add AcoustID
   amusic process --encode --replay-gain --acoust-id \
     --output-dir "/Music/Encoded" \
     "/Music/Lossless/Artist1" "/Music/Lossless/Artist2"
   ```
